# Non Dons Tools

**Non Dons Tools** is a legacy Discord bot I created 7 years ago using Python. It provided a mix of entertainment and utility features for Discord servers, including music playback, random fun commands, and server tools. Although it no longer functions due to Discord API changes, this project remains on GitHub as a portfolio piece to reflect my early programming experience.

## Features (at the time of development)

- 🎵 Play music in voice channels  
- 🎲 Fun commands (e.g., dice rolls, jokes, trivia)  
- 🛠️ Utility commands (e.g., message clearing, latency check)  
- 📈 Simple usage stats and command customization  

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**  
- **discord.py (pre-rewrite versions)**  
- **YouTube-dl** or **youtube_dl** (for music streaming)  
- **FFmpeg** (for audio playback)  

## Why It's Archived

Due to major updates in the Discord API and the discontinuation of key libraries (like `discord.py` as originally used), Non Dons Tools no longer runs in modern environments. This repository is preserved as a snapshot of my early work in real-time applications and bot development.

## Notes

- ⚠️ Not maintained or updated for compatibility  
- 💡 Code may reflect early coding practices and experimentation  
- 📚 Kept for archival and portfolio purposes only
